1. Iteration vs Looping
  + Looping is a programming construct that allows you to tell your program to do something a certain number of times, or until a certain condition is met. It is a mechanism to repeat a selection of code.
  + Useful for checking inputs or running a certain number of times.
2. Operating on a collection.
  + Let's say that we are writing a program to annoy our little brothers. We three little brothers: Tom, Tim and Jim, and we want to output "Stop hitting yourself, #{little brother's name}!" once for each brother? Let's try that out using a loop with the while construct: 
  + In order to output a simple phrase using each brother's name from our collection with a while loop we need to:
    * Establish a counter
    * Set the condition for the while loop
    * Increment the counter at the bottom of the loop
    * Read data out of the array by index using the counter.
